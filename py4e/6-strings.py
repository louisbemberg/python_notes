# challenge : which email service is this customer using?
email = "louis.bemberg@gmail.com"
# first, find the index of where the @ is:

# next, look for the FIRST DOT AFTER THE @:
dot = email.find('.', at_sign) # telling python to start looking from @ onwards
# extracting gmail:
email_provider = email[at_sign + 1 : dot]
print(email_provider) # gmail
